          <p>Sevilla's bus system is run by <a href="http://www.tussam.es/index.php?id=1">Tussam</a>, a local company. Tussam operates about 40 daily bus routes and a tram line. Once you learn how they work it'll made the stay just outside of town a lot easier. Basically, there are two bus routes the C1 and C2 that circle around the outlying areas of Sevilla. Both of them stop at or near the Prado de San Sebastian bus station, Santa Justa Train Station, and the tram. The only difference between the two is that the C1 rounds clockwise and the C2 counterclockwise. The C3 and C4 run just outside of old town and are the quickest way of getting to see the touristy sites. C3 runs clockwise and the C4 runs counterclockwise. Last the C5 bus line runs throughout the old town or historic city. It is hard to get lost on the C5 and most of the places you might want to see our on the line.</p>

                 <p>Rides cost 1.40€ each way when you pay on the bus. Bonobus ticket blocks are no longer sold, but you can buy a pass.  One day, 3 day, refillable, and monthly passes are available. The refillable pass is called the Tarjeta Multiviaje. It costs 1.50€ for the card (this is a refundable deposit) and a minimum fill-up of 7€. Refills are also 7€ minimum. There are two types: Con Transbordo (with transfer) or Sin Transbordo (without transfer) this allows transfer for 1 hour at different line from any source.  You pass the card over a meter in the bus, 0.69€ is deducted from your card. When you transfer, if you have the Con Transbordo pass, another 0.10€ is deducted. If you have the Sin Transbordo pass, another full 0.69€ is deducted. So you might as well get the Con Transbordo pass to begin with!</p>

              <p>The bus provides a cheap and fast transportation to the airport. If you want to go to the airport and you don’t live too far from the centre the bus is your best option. </p>
              <p>From Seville airport drives an airport bus every 30 minutes to the city center. There is only one bus (white) and the stop is on the left as you walk out of the arrival hall. You can buy a ticket on the bus for 4€ a person and in less than twenty minutes you are in the center. Do not buy a return ticket because you have to return the same day.</p>
              <p>This special bus also allows you to go from the airport to the center of Seville. This service is much cheaper than that offered by taxi drivers.</p>

          <p>A bicycle is just as convenient to get around the city center. Seville has a large network of (green paved) cycle paths. Rent a bike or use <a href="http://www.sevici.es" >Sevici</a>. These are bikes that you can take and park on different places (at least 250 bike stations) in the city. You only pay the rate of 13.30€ for 7 days. The first half hour is free after that a small fee will be charged.</p>
          
          <p>You can see a the map with the stations <a href="http://www.sevici.es/Estaciones/Mapa">here</a></p>

          <p>Do you want always to be sure of having your own bike? Prevent that your Sevici bicycle is not functioning properly or that you should look for another Sevici bike station (out of bicycles)? Then it is the best to rent a 'own' bike. Pia Tours can cheaply and easily arrange this for you so you are guaranteed with a 'own' bicycle on arrival. Send an e-mail to us to rent a bike.</p>

          <p>The Line 1 of the <a href="http://www.metro-sevilla.es/en">Seville</a> Underground carries out a route that is divided in three fare zones.</p>

          <p>The passage from one fare zone to another is known as a “hop” and the fare is set by the number of “hops” that travellers make between the point of origin and destination of their journey. Three types of hops can be made:</p>

          <p>0 hops: We move through the same stretch.<br>
          1 hop: We move on 2 stretches.<br>
          2 hops: We move on all three stretches that make up the Line 1.</p>

          <p>The Blas Infante and Pablo de Olavide stations are “border stations” and are considered common to both sections converging on it. If the journey is carried out from the confluent sections to one of these stations, it is considered as 0 hops. 
          The metro is open every day, usually from 6:30am or 7:30am to either 11pm or 2am, depending on the day (it closes late on weekends. Hours can change during holidays or the April Fair.</p>

          <p>For <a href="http://www.metro-sevilla.es/en/tickets-fares">tickets</a>, you can buy simple/one-way, return, or whole-day tickets. If you're staying longer and plan to use the metro a lot, you can also buy travel cards valid for multiple trips. </p>

        <p>Most people prefer to use <a href="http://www.radiotaxidesevilla.es/index.php">taxis</a> at night for speed and convenience. They are available any time, any day of the year, and are white with the city crest, a yellow stripe and their licence number on the side. You can hail them in the street when they have the green light on. They can also be found at taxi ranks in central streets and squares, or ordered using the radio taxi service. The fares are displayed inside the taxis and comprise the minimum rate, flag-down charge, kilometre charge and other extras such as night service, public holidays, and station or airport service. </p>
        <p>Count on about 25€ per taxi from airport to the center (one way and daytime). Evenings, nights and weekends are a more expensive.</p>
